Abstract = {We use density-functional theory to study the ordered states of iridium
   manganese, demonstrating a simple but powerful method for describing
   magnetic structures and the transitions among them. As an illustrative
   example, the coupling of magnetism and crystal structure in IrMn is
   examined through a rigorous exploration of strain space. We then
   generate order parameters for the ground-state magnetic structures,
   providing a comprehensive framework for understanding antiferromagnetic
   variants and their magnetic anisotropy. In particular, we show how the
   most direct path between two variant structures can be analytically
   determined; this technique is used to equate two seemingly contradictory
   prior studies.},
