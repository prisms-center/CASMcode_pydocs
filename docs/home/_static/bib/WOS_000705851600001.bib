Abstract = {Measuring the similarity between two arbitrary crystal structures is a
   common challenge in crystallography and materials science. Although
   there are an infinite number of ways to mathematically relate two
   crystal structures, only a few are physically meaningful. Here we
   introduce both a geometry-based and a symmetry-adapted similarity metric
   to compare crystal structures. Using crystal symmetry and combinatorial
   optimization we describe an algorithm to arrive at the structural
   relationship that minimizes these similarity metrics across all possible
   maps between any pair of crystal structures. The approach makes it
   possible to (i) identify pairs of crystal structures that are identical,
   (ii) quantitatively measure the similarity between crystal structures,
   and (iii) find and rank structural transformation pathways between any
   pair of crystal structures. We discuss the advantages of using the
   symmetry-adapted cost metric over the geometric cost. Finally, we show
   that all known structural transformation pathways between common crystal
   structures are recovered with the mapping algorithm. The methodology
   presented in this study will be of value to efforts that seek to
   catalogue crystal structures, identify structural transformation
   pathways or prune large first-principles datasets used to parameterize
   on-lattice Hamiltonians.},
