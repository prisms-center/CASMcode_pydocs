Abstract = {CASM is a software package that enables first-principles based studies
   of crystalline materials. It has been designed to treat coupled
   chemical, mechanical, vibrational, and magnetic degrees of freedom to
   determine ground state and finite temperature properties of crystals.
   The symmetry of the underlying parent crystal structure is used to
   enumerate perturbations of the parent crystal structure and generate
   derivative structures which can be input to first-principles
   calculations in order to explore the ground state energy landscape. CASM
   algorithmically constructs cluster expansions that fully couple discrete
   and continuous degrees of freedom, and generates highly efficient code
   to evaluate the cluster expansion basis functions. Widely used machine
   learning methods are integrated for fitting expansion coefficients to
   first-principle calculations. The fully parameterized cluster expansions
   can be combined with (kinetic) Monte Carlo methods to calculate finite
   temperature thermodynamic and kinetic properties. CASM Alloy Manager
   identifies distinct parent crystal structures in an alloy system,
   creating individual projects for each, and integrating the results. The
   integrated infrastructure facilitates the linkage between
   first-principles statistical mechanics predictions with higher length
   scale computational methods, such as phase field simulations. CASM
   projects are designed to be easy to share in repositories, to re-use,
   and to extend to include additional chemical species or types of degrees
   of freedom.},
