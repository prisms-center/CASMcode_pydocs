Abstract = {Accurate thermodynamic descriptions are a key ingredient to kinetic
   theories that describe the mesoscale evolution of a solid undergoing
   ordering or decomposition reactions. We introduce a general approach to
   identify order parameters for order-disorder reactions and to calculate
   first-principles free-energy surfaces as a function of these order
   parameters. The symmetry of the disordered phase is used to formulate
   order parameters as linear combinations of sublattice compositions of a
   reference supercell. The order parameters can distinguish the disordered
   phase from the symmetrically equivalent variants of a particular ordered
   phase. A thermodynamic formalism is then developed to rigorously define
   a coarse-grained free energy as a function of order parameters. Bias
   potentials are added to the potential energy to enable sampling of the
   unstable regions within the order parameter domain. Monte Carlo sampling
   in the biased ensemble is combined with free-energy integration to
   calculate high-temperature free energies. We illustrate the approach by
   analyzing the free energies of order-disorder transitions on a
   two-dimensional triangular lattice and in the technologically important
   Ni-Al alloy.},
